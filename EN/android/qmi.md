## Introduction

QMi Assistant is a product form of QMi in the game scene and is designed to provide players all kinds of auxiliary tools (which do not affect the game balance) in the game process and co-work with app and portals to create community services exclusively for the players. After QMi integrates Assistant SDK and adds a function menu, it can display in the form of suspension icon on the Android mobile phone interface after the game is started.

It includes three functions: acceleration, raid and forum. Currently, its DAU is 3 million, and its daily active retention rate is 60%.
