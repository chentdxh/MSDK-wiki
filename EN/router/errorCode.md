# MSDK Backend Error Codes #

## 1 Overview ##

1. MSDK error codes are divided into access layer, logic layer and platform layer error codes.
2. Common errors, such as appid error, appkey error and permission control, are directly returned by the access layer; as for the specific meanings of the errors, please refer to the error codes of the msdk access layer.
3. When the logic layer has errors, the MSDK access layer will transparently transmit the error code ret and error description msg, in which ret is defined by the MSDK logic layer.
4. If the business error of the platform layer, such as mobile QQ token error, occurs, MSDK will return ret: -10000, msg: platform error code, platform error description, such as: "msg": 73, the user modifies password wrongly"
5. If the business error of the platform layer, such as WeChat error, occurs, MSDK will return ret: -20000, msg: platform error code, platform error description, such as: “msg”: “40001, invalid credential"
6. The MSDK access layer has classifed error codes and adds a new parameter err_type: 0: normal, 1: the network is not stable, please try again later, 2: re-authorize. 3: use refreshToken to refresh acessToken. 5: unknown error
